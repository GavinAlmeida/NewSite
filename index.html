            <h3>Development and Design</h3>
            <p>I began learning to code around a year and a half ago. I have taken courses from The App Brewery Bootcamp, U of M, Saginaw Valley State University, Delta College, Codecademy, Udemy, etc. to further my knowledge on coding while going to school and then eventually going into IT. I enjoy coding as it is a passion for me. I love creating websites and other things while using technical abilities and brain power.</p>

            <h3>Cloud Computing</h3>
            <p>I have always been a fan of software over hardware. I began my journey in IT with traditional hardware and network configurations but switched to the Cloud as I had more enjoyment working with Azure than typical servers and networks. I am a also a Cloud certification holder for Azure and the CompTIA A+.</p>
